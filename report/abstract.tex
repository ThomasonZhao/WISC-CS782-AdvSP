  Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols offer a more secure alternative to traditional password-based authentication by establishing a secure session key between a client and server without directly exposing the user's password. This project evaluated the usability of two PAKE protocols - Secure Remote Password (SRP) and OPAQUE - compared to a baseline password-over-TLS authentication mechanism to assess their performance, scalability, and user experience. Through experiments measuring server-side resource utilization and a user study with 136 participants, we found that while PAKE protocols provide stronger security guarantees, they can incur higher computational overhead on the server compared to basic password-over-TLS authentication. However, participants generally felt more secure and preferred the PAKE-based authentication, despite the increased response times. These insights contribute to understanding the practical considerations for deploying PAKE protocols in real-world applications, informing decision-makers on balancing security, efficiency, and user-friendliness.
