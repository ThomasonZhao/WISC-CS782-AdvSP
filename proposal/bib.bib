  abstract  = {User authentication is a crucial requirement for secure transactions and access to the sensitive resources on the Web. We propose, implement and evaluate a Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication (ZKP) algorithm based on isomorphic graphs. The proposed mechanism allows for authentication with varying confidence and security levels.We suggest that most of the computations should be carried out by the user's web browser without revealing password or login at any point in time; instead generated random isomorphic graphs and permutation functions based on the user login/password can be exchanged.Our experimental evaluation shows that by combining the asynchronous web with ZKP protocols, it is feasible to satisfy existing usability standards on the web.},

After formally defining this notion, we show its relevance to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based identification schemes. In the last part of the paper we consider the question of sequential versus parallel executions of zero knowledge protocols, define a new notion of “transferable information”, and prove that the parallel version of our identification scheme (which is not known to be zero knowledge) is secure since it reveals no transferable information.},

  abstract = { Usually, a proof of a theorem contains more knowledge than the mere fact that the theorem is true. For instance, to prove that a graph is Hamiltonian it suffices to exhibit a Hamiltonian tour in it; however, this seems to contain more knowledge than the single bit Hamiltonian/non-Hamiltonian.In this paper a computational complexity theory of the “knowledge” contained in a proof is developed. Zero-knowledge proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge proof systems are given for the languages of quadratic residuosity and 'quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the first examples of zero-knowledge proofs for languages not known to be efficiently recognizable. }

  abstract = {Current authentication protocols seek to establish authenticated sessions over insecure channels while maintaining a small footprint considering the energy consumption and computational overheads. Traditional authentication schemes must store a form of authentication data on the devices, putting this data at risk. Approaches based on purely public/private key infrastructure come with additional computation and maintenance costs. This work proposes a novel non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZKP) authentication protocol that incorporates the limiting factors in IoT communication devices and sensors. Our protocol considers the inherent network instability and replaces the ZKP NP-hard problem using the Merkle tree structure for the creation of the authentication challenge. A series of simulations evaluate the performance of NIZKP against traditional ZKP approaches based on graph isomorphism. A set of performance metrics has been used, namely the channel rounds for client authentication, effects of the authentication processes, and the protocol interactions to determine areas of improvements. The simulation results indicate empirical evidence for the suitability of our NIKP approach for authentication purposes in resource-constrained IoT environments.}

  abstract = {User authentication systems (in short authentication systems) have wide utilization in our daily life. Unfortunately, existing authentication systems are prone to various attacks while both system security and usability are expected to be satisfied. But the current research still lacks a thorough survey on various types of attacks and corresponding countermeasures regarding user authentication, including traditional password-based and emerging biometric-based systems. In this paper, we make a comprehensive review on attacks and defenses of the authentication systems. We firstly introduce a number of common attacks by classifying them into different categories based on attacker knowledge, attack target, attack form and attack strength. Then, we propose a set of evaluation criteria for evaluating different kinds of attack defense mechanisms. Furthermore, we review and evaluate the existing methods of detecting and resisting attacks in the authentication systems by employing the proposed evaluation criteria as a common measure. Specifically, we focus on comparing and analyzing the performance of different defense mechanisms in different types of authentication systems. Through serious review and analysis, we put forward a number of open issues and propose some promising future research directions, hoping to inspire further research in this field.}

  abstract  = {Authentication is the process of validating the identity of someone or something. It uses information provided to the authenticatorAuthenticator to determine whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be. In private and public computing systems, for example, in computer networks, the process of authentication commonly involves someone, usually the user, using a password provided by the system administrator to logon. The user's possession of a password is meant to guarantee that the user is authentic. It means that at some previous time, the user requested, from the system administrator, and the administrator assigned and or registered a self-selected password. The user presents this password to the logon to prove that he or she knows something no one else could know. Generally, authentication requires the presentation of credentials or items of value to really prove the claim of who one is. This chapter discusses this process of authentic proof of a system user.},
